//planned: a firebase folder directly in the front-end
//choices of firebase implementation: BE, FE, mixed
//BE: might be easiser to think in abstract, but might just add overhead in
//tech development and write more codes
//FE: less overhead, but might be a bit messy in the future depending on whether we'd
//also need the firebase data in the backend
//if implemented in FE, can be a folder with authentication, cloud functions, database,
//configs all in their own files
